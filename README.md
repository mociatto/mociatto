## 🧠 About Me

I'm an engineer and researcher with a strong foundation in **Electrical & Instrumentation Engineering** and a passion for **AI research**, especially in **Federated Learning**, **Edge AI**, and **Adversarial Robustness**. After a decade of engineering and project management experience, I transitioned into research to explore how distributed intelligence can enhance security, efficiency, and scalability in real-world systems.

Currently pursuing my M.Sc. by Research in Computer Science at the University of Hull, I am focused on **vertical federated learning**, **neurosymbolic AI**, and **robustness against adversarial attacks** in decentralized networks.
